# Tic-Tac-Toe 2.0
TicTacToe Application Version 2.0

This application is an improvement from the previous version (Watermelon Tic-Tac-Toe). It provides a completely new look and experience. 
It introduces new selectable characters and a faster and more efficient A.I. Additionally, the lag experienced in the previous iteration was reduced/removed
(depending on the speed of the device).

### Modes

**Single-Player**

   **Easy** - Very easy level. The system simply chooses a random spot on the board.
  
  **Medium** - Uses a modified version of the minimax algorithm and gives the player a chance to actually win.
  
  **Hard** - Improves the previous use of the minimax algorithm by having the A.I select either the middle and or top left in the first move. These are the 
  most optimal moves and we have the A.I choose this option directly, instead of having to use a heavy amount of system resources to come to that same conclusion. 
  This level is impossible to win, the A.I will always choose the most optimal position on the board.

**Two-Players**
 
 This mode allows the players to each select their own character. Here the loser of a given game will be allowed to go first. If a game results in a tie,
  then whoever went first that round will go second.
